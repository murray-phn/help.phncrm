Risk Assessments \u00b6 Risk is the likelihood and effect/consequences of uncertainty on business objectives \u2013 anything which may potentially cause performance variance from company objectives. Your PHN CRM has built-in tools to allow you to identify, assess, escalte, mitigate and report on your risks. Risk Categories \u00b6 People & Culture\u200b Clinical\u200b Health Outcomes\u200b Political\u200b Reputational\u200b Legal / Regulatory\u200b Financial\u200b Business Operations\u200b Cybersecurity Counter-Party Risk Assessments (CPRA) \u00b6 Assessing your counter-party risk. As a minimum, counterparty risk assessments are to be commenced or updated: Upon a counterparty submitting information to Murray PHN during a procurement process. Upon a counterparty submitting information to Murray PHN on voluntary basis. Upon Murray PHN receiving additional information on an existing counterparty from another source. Upon a contract escalating to an amber or red risk. During an annual review of a counterparty The tool focuses on the five (5) key identified risk themes: Strategic Alignment Service Delivery Regulatory and Accreditation Financial Reputation The Counterparty Risk Assessment Tool has a notes and attachment section in the file for each account that should be used to keep a copy of any documentation applicable to all assessments. The resulting risk score will determine specific actions that are required, refer to table below: Please note: Refer to the Counterparty Risk Assessment Policy for examples of risk mitigation strategies that can be put in place. Regular reviews \u00b6 The Counterparty Risk Assessment procedure is a cyclical process that requires constant evaluation and updating. To this end, the procedure is to be repeated on an annual basis and where new market intelligence comes to light and comes to the attention of Murray PHN staff members. EwR Dashboard \u00b6 Your PHN CRM has a built-in dashboard that gives your team a high-level snapshot of all Risks entered in the system. The EwR Dashboard can be accessed in the Business Area. Risk Matrix \u00b6 The Risk Matrix sorts all the Risk records onto a matrix (likelihood & consequence). Each Risk is displayed as a 'bubble' with its ID shown. Hovering over a 'bubble' allows you to see both inherent and residual risk rating, as well as the name of the Risk. Clicking a 'bubble' opens that Risk in a new winow. Using the provided filters, you can: Display risks using Inherent or Residual risk ratings Show or hide unapproved Risks Filter by Category, Location, Created By, Owner, Effectiveness of Mitigation, Consequence & Likelihood You may also print the Risk Matrix using the 'print' button, or you may manually 'snip' a screenshot of the Matrix to include in reports. Summary Table \u00b6 The Summary Table provides a breakdown of your Risks by category and rating. Word Cloud \u00b6 The Risk Word Cloud calculates the number of occurences of each word used to define Risks, and then displays the most common words in a 'cloud'. The larger the word is displayed, the more commonly it is used. This tool demonstrates which topics or themes are dominating Risk in your PHN. Counter-Party Risk \u00b6 The Counter-Party Risk tab displays all CPRAs in descending score. Click 'Open' to view/edit that CPRA in a new window.

The User's position and responsibilities will determine what Roles they require. The Security Roles are set up to be very simple. Typically there is a Security Role for each entity (e.g. Controlled Documents, CPRA, Risk). Most Security Roles give 'Read, Create, Write, Append, Assign' permission for that entity. Remember, auditing is enabled for most entities so all changes are tracked. See the list of Security Roles How to change a User's Security Roles: Go to the list of Users and select the User. In the command bar, click 'Manage Roles'. Check/Uncheck the Security Roles you want the User to have.
