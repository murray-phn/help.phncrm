A single email/call can only have a single Activity Category. If for example, a staff member records an appointment with a Practice and discusses multiple projects/topics, the staff member should either select the 'primary' Activity Category, or an Activity Category record is created and used to represent a range of topics usually covered during meetings with practices.","title":"Activity Category"},{"location":"entities/agreement/","text":"Agreement \u00b6 This section has not been completed.","title":"Agreement"},{"location":"entities/agreement/#agreement","text":"This section has not been completed.","title":"Agreement"},{"location":"entities/appointment/","text":"Appointment \u00b6 This section has not been completed.","title":"Appointment"},{"location":"entities/appointment/#appointment","text":"This section has not been completed.","title":"Appointment"},{"location":"entities/call/","text":"Call \u00b6 This section has not been completed.","title":"Call"},{"location":"entities/call/#call","text":"This section has not been completed.","title":"Call"},{"location":"entities/contact-role-type/","text":"Contact Role Type \u00b6 This section has not been completed.","title":"Contact Role Type"},{"location":"entities/contact-role-type/#contact-role-type","text":"This section has not been completed.","title":"Contact Role Type"},{"location":"entities/contact-role/","text":"Contact Role \u00b6 Contacts can have many 'Roles' with Accounts.
