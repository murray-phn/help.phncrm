# Contact

Contacts are individual people with whom you have a relationship. Often contacts are related to an account.

Contacts integrate with the contacts in Microsoft Outlook, so it is important to understand that when fields on the contact record are updated, that change may synchronize to Outlook for one or more users depending on synchronization settings.
