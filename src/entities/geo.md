## Overview

PHN CRM contains thousands of records that each represent a single geographical boundary of a type.

The following boundaries are included:

- STE (States)

- SSC (Suburbs)

- POA (Postcode)

- PHNs

- SA4 (Statistical Area Level 4)

- SA3 (Statistical Area Level 3)

- SA2 (Statistical Area Level 2)

- SA1 (Statistical Area Level 1)

- LGA (Local Government Area)

- CED (Commonwealth Election Division)

- SED (State Electoral Division)

[ABS Descriptions](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1270.0.55.001Explanatory%20Notes1July%202016)

The physical boundaries of each area of each type are visible in CRM on an interactive map.

Some boundary types are linked to others. For example, you can see a list of SA1s contained in an SA2. POA (Postcodes) are linked to SSCs (Suburbs) and Suburbs are linked to LGAs. This linkage of data increases reporting capabilities.

Each area also has a direct link to the 'ABS Quick Stats' page for that area, which provides additional detailed demographics.

## Address Auto-fill

With one click, the system can locate the address of an Account and automatically fill in which SSC, POA, LGA, SA1-4 that Account resides within.

This provides several significant benefits:

- Find and export all Accounts within an LGA (you can filter by Account Type, e.g. General Practice).

- Consistent, accurate data: Suburbs are not misspelled. Accounts are not placed in the wrong areas which means they can miss out on funding.

- See total number of Accounts within an area.
